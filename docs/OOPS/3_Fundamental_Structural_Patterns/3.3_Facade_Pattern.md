## Facade Pattern
### Core Concepts

*   **Intent:** Provides a simplified, unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
*   **Goal:** Makes the subsystem easier to use by abstracting away its complexity.
*   **Structural Pattern:** Organizes classes and objects into larger structures by identifying a simple way to express relationships.
*   **Decoupling:** Reduces dependencies between the client and the complex subsystem.

### Key Details & Nuances

*   **Single Entry Point:** The Facade class acts as the sole entry point for clients to interact with the subsystem.
*   **Hides Complexity:** It encapsulates the intricate workings of multiple classes, presenting a clean API.
*   **Not an Abstraction Layer:** It's not meant to hide the *existence* of the subsystem, but rather its internal complexity.
*   **Can Delegate:** The Facade itself doesn't perform the work; it delegates requests to the appropriate objects within the subsystem.
*   **Layering:** Facades can be used to define entry points to layers within a system.
*   **Open/Closed Principle:** A well-designed facade allows the subsystem to evolve without affecting clients, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

### Practical Examples

Imagine a complex audio/video playback system with separate components for decoding, rendering, and audio output.

```typescript
// Subsystem Components
class AudioMixer {
    mixAudio(audios: string[]): string {
        return `Mixing: ${audios.join(', ')}`;
    }
}

class VideoDecoder {
    decodeVideo(file: string): string {
        return `Decoding: ${file}`;
    }
}

class VideoRenderer {
    renderVideo(decoded: string): string {
        return `Rendering: ${decoded}`;
    }
}

// Facade
class MediaFacade {
    private audioMixer: AudioMixer;
    private videoDecoder: VideoDecoder;
    private videoRenderer: VideoRenderer;

    constructor() {
        this.audioMixer = new AudioMixer();
        this.videoDecoder = new VideoDecoder();
        this.videoRenderer = new VideoRenderer();
    }

    playMovie(fileName: string): string {
        const decodedVideo = this.videoDecoder.decodeVideo(fileName);
        const renderedVideo = this.videoRenderer.renderVideo(decodedVideo);
        const mixedAudio = this.audioMixer.mixAudio([fileName + ".audio"]);
        return `${renderedVideo} + ${mixedAudio}`;
    }

    stopMovie(): void {
        console.log("Stopping movie...");
    }
}

// Client Usage
const mediaFacade = new MediaFacade();
const result = mediaFacade.playMovie("interstellar.mp4");
console.log(result); // Output: Rendering: Decoding: interstellar.mp4 + Mixing: interstellar.mp4.audio
mediaFacade.stopMovie();
```

### Common Pitfalls & Trade-offs

*   **God Object Risk:** A poorly designed facade can become a "god object," taking on too much responsibility and violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
*   **Tight Coupling to Subsystem:** If the facade knows too much about the internal implementation details of the subsystem, it can become tightly coupled, reducing flexibility.
*   **Not a Replacement for Abstraction:** Facades don't replace other forms of abstraction like interfaces or abstract classes, but rather complement them.
*   **Adding Another Layer:** Introduces an additional layer of indirection, which might be considered overhead in very simple systems.

### Interview Questions

1.  **When would you choose to implement the Facade pattern, and what problem does it solve?**
    *   **Answer:** Implement the Facade pattern when a subsystem has many complex classes and interfaces, making it difficult for clients to interact with. It simplifies the subsystem's usage by providing a single, unified interface, reducing client-side dependencies and complexity.

2.  **How does the Facade pattern differ from an Adapter pattern?**
    *   **Answer:** An Adapter pattern is used to convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. It's about making incompatible interfaces work together. A Facade pattern, on the other hand, simplifies a complex subsystem by providing a unified, higher-level interface, but it doesn't change the underlying interfaces themselves.

3.  **Can a Facade be tightly coupled to its subsystem, and if so, what are the implications?**
    *   **Answer:** Yes, a Facade *can* become tightly coupled if it has too much knowledge of the subsystem's internal workings. This negates some of the benefits, as changes in the subsystem might require changes in the Facade, and consequently, in the clients. Good design aims to minimize this coupling by having the Facade delegate without internalizing too much subsystem logic.

4.  **Is the Facade pattern considered a creational, structural, or behavioral pattern, and why?**
    *   **Answer:** It's a structural pattern. This is because it deals with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures, specifically by simplifying the relationships and interactions between a client and a complex subsystem.
