## git log
### Core Concepts

*   **`git log`**: A Git command used to display a list of commit history.
*   **Commit Object**: Each entry in the log represents a commit, which is a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.
*   **Metadata**: Each commit includes essential information like author, committer, date, and commit message.

### Key Details & Nuances

*   **Default Output**:
    *   Commit Hash (SHA-1): Unique identifier for each commit.
    *   Author: Name and email of the person who wrote the code.
    *   Date: When the commit was authored.
    *   Commit Message: A description of the changes.
*   **Commonly Used Flags**:
    *   `--oneline`: Displays each commit on a single line (hash + subject). Excellent for a quick overview.
    *   `--graph`: Displays the commit history as an ASCII graph, showing branches and merges. Crucial for visualizing lineage.
    *   `--decorate`: Shows any references (like branch or tag names) that point to a commit.
    *   `--author="<pattern>"`: Filters commits by author.
    *   `--committer="<pattern>"`: Filters commits by committer.
    *   `--since="<date>"` / `--until="<date>"`: Filters commits within a date range.
    *   `--grep="<pattern>"`: Filters commits whose message matches a pattern.
    *   `-p` / `--patch`: Shows the diff (changes) introduced by each commit. Essential for code review context.
    *   `--stat`: Shows statistics for each commit (files changed, insertions/deletions).
    *   `--pretty=<format>`: Allows custom formatting of the log output (e.g., `short`, `medium`, `full`, `format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"`).
*   **Rev-List Syntax**: `git log` internally uses rev-list logic to traverse the commit graph. Understanding this allows for powerful filtering and selection of commits (e.g., `git log A..B` for commits reachable from B but not A).
*   **Referencing Commits**: You can specify a starting point for the log (e.g., `git log main`, `git log HEAD~3`, `git log <commit-hash>`).

### Practical Examples

*   **Show the last 5 commits, one line each, with graph and decorations**:

    ```sh
    git log --oneline --graph --decorate -n 5
    ```
*   **Show commits from a specific author with patch**:

    ```sh
    git log --author="Alice" -p
    ```
*   **Show commits that modified a specific file**:

    ```sh
    git log -- <path/to/file>
    ```
*   **Show commits whose message contains "fix bug"**:

    ```sh
    git log --grep="fix bug"
    ```
*   **Visualize branch history**:

    ```mermaid
    graph TD;
        A["Commit A"] --> B["Commit B"];
        A --> C["Commit C"];
        B --> D["Commit D"];
        C --> E["Commit E - Merge"];
        D --> E;
    ```

    (Executing `git log --graph --decorate --oneline` would produce a similar visual representation.)

### Common Pitfalls & Trade-offs

*   **Overwhelming Output**: Without flags, `git log` can produce a lot of information, making it hard to find specific commits. Use flags like `--oneline`, `--grep`, and date filters to narrow down results.
*   **Confusing Author vs. Committer**: Understand the difference: author is who wrote the code, committer is who applied the commit (e.g., after a rebase).
*   **Performance**: For very large repositories, `git log` can be slow if not filtered effectively. Always consider adding filters (date, author, path) when searching for specific information.
*   **`git log` vs. `git reflog`**: `git log` shows committed history. `git reflog` shows local updates to your HEAD and branch references (e.g., resets, checkouts, commits), acting as a local "undo" history.

### Interview Questions

*   **How would you find the commit that introduced a specific bug?**
    *   **Answer**: Use `git log -p --grep="<bug_description>"` to search commit messages and view changes. More effectively, use `git bisect` which automates a binary search through commit history to pinpoint the exact commit that introduced a regression.
*   **What's the difference between `--author` and `--committer` flags in `git log`?**
    *   **Answer**: `--author` refers to the person who originally wrote the code in the commit. `--committer` refers to the person who last applied the commit to the repository (e.g., if a commit was amended or cherry-picked).
*   **How can you see the history of a specific file and view the changes made in each commit?**
    *   **Answer**: Use `git log --follow --patch -- <path/to/file>`. The `--follow` flag is useful for tracking history even if the file has been renamed. `--patch` or `-p` shows the diff.
*   **Explain the `--graph` option for `git log`. Why is it useful?**
    *   **Answer**: The `--graph` option displays the commit history as an ASCII graph. It's invaluable for visualizing branching and merging patterns, helping to understand the project's development timeline and how different lines of work converged.
*   **How would you display only the commit hash and the subject line for the last 3 commits?**
    *   **Answer**: `git log --oneline -n 3` or `git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" -n 3`.
