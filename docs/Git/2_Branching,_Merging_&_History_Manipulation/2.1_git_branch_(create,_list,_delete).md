## git branch (create, list, delete)
### Core Concepts

*   **Branching:** Git branches are independent lines of development. They allow developers to work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase (e.g., `main` or `master`).
*   **`git branch`:** The primary command for managing branches.
    *   **Listing:** Shows all local branches, with the current branch highlighted.
    *   **Creating:** Creates a new branch pointing to the current commit.
    *   **Deleting:** Removes a branch.

### Key Details & Nuances

*   **Lightweight:** Branches in Git are essentially just pointers to commits. Creating/deleting them is very fast and cheap.
*   **Current Branch (`HEAD`):** `HEAD` is a pointer to the currently checked-out branch. When you create a new branch, `HEAD` points to that new branch.
*   **Branch Naming Conventions:** Common conventions include:
    *   `feature/issue-number-short-description`
    *   `bugfix/issue-number-short-description`
    *   `hotfix/short-description`
*   **Remote Branches:** `git branch` primarily operates on local branches. Remote branches are counterparts on a remote repository (e.g., `origin/main`).

### Practical Examples

*   **List Branches:**
    ```sh
    git branch
    ```
    *Output example:*
    ```
      feature/new-login
    * main
      staging
    ```
    (The asterisk `*` indicates the current branch)

*   **Create a New Branch:**
    ```sh
    # Creates a new branch named 'experimental'
    git branch experimental

    # Creates and switches to the new branch in one command
    git checkout -b experimental
    ```

*   **Delete a Branch:**
    ```sh
    # Delete a local branch (if unmerged)
    git branch -d experimental

    # Force delete a local branch (even if unmerged) - use with caution!
    git branch -D experimental
    ```

*   **Visualizing Branching (Conceptual):**

    ```mermaid
    graph TD;
        A["Initial Commit"] --> B["Commit 1 (main)"];
        B --> C["Commit 2 (main)"];
        C --> D["Commit 3 (feature/A)"];
        C --> E["Commit 4 (main)"];
        D --> F["Commit 5 (feature/A)"];
    ```

    *   If `HEAD` is at `E`, and `feature/A` points to `F`.
    *   `git branch` would show:
        ```
          feature/A
        * main
        ```

### Common Pitfalls & Trade-offs

*   **Deleting Merged Branches:** Using `git branch -d` is generally safer as it prevents deletion of branches that haven't been fully merged. However, if you *know* you don't need the history from an unmerged branch and want to clean up, `-D` is necessary.
*   **Branch Drift:** Branches can become stale if the base branch (`main`) is updated frequently. Regular rebasing or merging from `main` into feature branches is crucial to keep them up-to-date.
*   **Too Many Branches:** While cheap, having an excessive number of branches can lead to confusion and merge conflicts. A clear branching strategy is essential.

### Interview Questions

1.  **What is a Git branch and why do we use them?**
    *   **Answer:** A Git branch is an independent line of development that allows developers to isolate changes. We use branches to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without disrupting the main codebase, enabling parallel development and reducing the risk of introducing instability.

2.  **Explain the difference between `git branch <name>` and `git checkout -b <name>` or `git switch -c <name>`.**
    *   **Answer:** `git branch <name>` creates a new branch pointer but doesn't switch to it. `git checkout -b <name>` (or `git switch -c <name>`) creates the new branch *and* immediately switches `HEAD` to that new branch, making it the active branch for subsequent commits.

3.  **How would you delete a local branch that has unmerged changes?**
    *   **Answer:** You would use `git branch -D <branch-name>`. The `-D` flag is a forced deletion, overriding Git's safety check that prevents deleting branches with unmerged commits. This should be used cautiously, as those changes might be lost if not otherwise backed up or merged.

4.  **What happens to a branch when you delete it?**
    *   **Answer:** Deleting a branch removes the pointer that referred to the latest commit on that branch. The commits themselves are not immediately removed from Git's object database. They become "dangling" and will eventually be garbage collected by Git if they are no longer referenced by any branch, tag, or other Git references.
