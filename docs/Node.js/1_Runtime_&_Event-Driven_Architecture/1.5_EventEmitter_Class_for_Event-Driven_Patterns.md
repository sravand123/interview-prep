## EventEmitter Class for Event-Driven Patterns
### Core Concepts
*   **Purpose:** The `EventEmitter` class is a fundamental part of Node.js's event-driven architecture. It allows objects to emit named events that cause registered listener functions to be called.
*   **Publish/Subscribe Pattern:** It implements the Observer pattern (often referred to as Publish/Subscribe), enabling loose coupling between components. One part of the application can "publish" an event, and other independent parts can "subscribe" to that event without direct knowledge of each other.
*   **Core Methods:**
    *   `on(eventName, listener)`: Registers a `listener` function to be called when `eventName` is emitted. Aliased as `addListener`.
    *   `emit(eventName, [...args])`: Synchronously calls every registered listener for the `eventName`, passing `args` to each listener.
    *   `removeListener(eventName, listener)`: Removes a specific listener.
    *   `once(eventName, listener)`: Registers a listener that is invoked at most once for `eventName`, then automatically removed.

### Key Details & Nuances
*   **Synchronous Execution:** All listeners for a given event are invoked **synchronously** in the order they were registered when `emit` is called. This can be a gotcha for long-running listeners, as it blocks the event loop.
*   **Error Handling (`'error'` event):**
    *   If an `EventEmitter` emits an `'error'` event and there are **no listeners** for it, the Node.js process will **crash** and exit.
    *   It is crucial to always have a listener for the `'error'` event when using `EventEmitter` in production systems.
    *   The `'error'` event should be used for exceptional, unrecoverable situations within the event flow.
*   **Inheritance vs. Instantiation:**
    *   You can create a standalone `EventEmitter` instance (`const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();`).
    *   More commonly, you extend `EventEmitter` for custom classes to give them event-emitting capabilities (`class MyClass extends EventEmitter {}`). This is often seen in Node.js core modules (e.g., `http.Server`, `net.Socket`).
*   **Maximum Listeners:** By default, an `EventEmitter` will warn if more than 10 listeners are registered for a single event to help detect potential memory leaks. This limit can be adjusted using `setMaxListeners(n)`.
*   **Memory Leaks:** Forgetting to call `removeListener` for listeners that are no longer needed can lead to memory leaks, especially in long-running applications or when dealing with frequently created/destroyed objects.

### Practical Examples

**1. Basic Custom Event Usage:**

```typescript
import { EventEmitter } from 'events';

// Create a custom emitter instance
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// 1. Register a listener for 'userLoggedIn'
myEmitter.on('userLoggedIn', (username: string, timestamp: number) => {
  console.log(`[LOG] User ${username} logged in at ${new Date(timestamp).toLocaleString()}`);
});

// 2. Register another listener for the same event
myEmitter.on('userLoggedIn', (username: string) => {
  console.log(`[ALERT] Sending welcome email to ${username}...`);
});

// 3. Register a 'once' listener
myEmitter.once('firstInteraction', (userId: string) => {
  console.log(`[INIT] First interaction detected for user ${userId}. (This will only run once)`);
});

// 4. Handle potential errors
myEmitter.on('error', (err: Error) => {
  console.error(`[ERROR] Something went wrong: ${err.message}`);
  // In a real app, you'd log this, potentially alert, and decide if to exit/recover.
});

// Emit events
myEmitter.emit('userLoggedIn', 'Alice', Date.now()); // Both listeners for 'userLoggedIn' will fire
myEmitter.emit('firstInteraction', 'user123'); // 'firstInteraction' listener fires once
myEmitter.emit('userLoggedIn', 'Bob', Date.now()); // Both listeners for 'userLoggedIn' fire again
myEmitter.emit('firstInteraction', 'user123'); // This will NOT trigger the 'firstInteraction' listener again

// Demonstrate an error
// myEmitter.emit('error', new Error('Failed to process user data!'));
```

### Common Pitfalls & Trade-offs
*   **Ignoring `'error'` events:** This is a critical mistake. An unhandled `'error'` event crashes the application, which is unacceptable in production. Always provide a listener.
*   **Memory Leaks from Unremoved Listeners:** Especially in long-running services, if you attach listeners dynamically to objects that are frequently created/destroyed, and don't remove them, these listeners (and the closures they hold) will remain in memory. Use `removeListener` or `once` appropriately.
*   **Synchronous Blocking:** Because `emit` calls listeners synchronously, if a listener performs a long-running synchronous operation, it will block the Node.js event loop, impacting the responsiveness of your application. For long-running tasks, listeners should offload work to asynchronous operations (e.g., Promises, `setImmediate`, worker threads).
*   **Overuse/Misuse:** Not every callback or interaction requires an `EventEmitter`. For simple one-off interactions, direct function calls, Promises, or async/await might be clearer and more appropriate. `EventEmitter` shines in scenarios with multiple, decoupled consumers of an event.

### Interview Questions
1.  **Explain the role of `EventEmitter` in Node.js's event-driven architecture. When would you choose to use it over a simple callback pattern or Promises?**
    *   **Answer:** `EventEmitter` provides a mechanism for decoupled components to communicate via named events (publish/subscribe pattern). You'd choose it when:
        *   **One-to-many communication:** A single event source needs to notify multiple, independent consumers.
        *   **Decoupling:** Components don't need direct knowledge of each other, only the event contract.
        *   **Custom events:** You're building a custom class or module that needs to expose its internal state changes or actions to external consumers.
        *   Callbacks are for one-to-one, direct invocation. Promises are for single-result asynchronous operations, often with error handling. `EventEmitter` excels at broadcasting dynamic, multiple events.

2.  **What happens if you `emit('error', new Error('Something failed'))` and there are no listeners for the `'error'` event? How do you prevent this?**
    *   **Answer:** If an `'error'` event is emitted without any registered listeners, the Node.js process will throw the error as an uncaught exception, which typically leads to the process crashing and exiting. To prevent this, you **must** always register at least one listener for the `'error'` event: `myEmitter.on('error', (err) => { console.error('Unhandled error:', err); /* ... logging, graceful shutdown ... */ });`.

3.  **Describe a potential memory leak scenario involving `EventEmitter` and how you would mitigate it.**
    *   **Answer:** A common memory leak occurs when listeners are added to an `EventEmitter` instance, but never removed. If the `EventEmitter` instance itself has a longer lifecycle than the objects adding listeners, those listener functions (and their closures, retaining references to their scope) will accumulate in memory, even if the "listening" object is otherwise garbage collected. Mitigation involves:
        *   Using `emitter.once()` for events that should only trigger once.
        *   Calling `emitter.removeListener(eventName, listenerFunction)` when a listener is no longer needed (e.g., when a component unmounts or is destroyed).
        *   Calling `emitter.removeAllListeners([eventName])` to clear all listeners for a specific event or all events.

4.  **Is the `emit` method synchronous or asynchronous? What are the implications of this design choice?**
    *   **Answer:** The `emit` method is **synchronous**. When `emit` is called, all registered listeners are executed immediately and in order before the `emit` call returns.
    *   **Implications:**
        *   **Predictable Order:** Listener execution order is guaranteed.
        *   **Blocking Event Loop:** If any listener performs a computationally intensive or long-running synchronous task, it will block the Node.js event loop, preventing other operations (like handling new network requests) from occurring, leading to reduced application responsiveness.
        *   **No Asynchronous Results:** Listeners cannot return values directly back to the `emit` caller in a meaningful way. If listeners need to perform async operations, they should handle their own Promises/callbacks, and the emitter itself won't wait for them.
