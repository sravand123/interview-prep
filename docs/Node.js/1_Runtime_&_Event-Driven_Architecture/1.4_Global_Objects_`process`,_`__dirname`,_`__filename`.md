## Global Objects: `process`, `__dirname`, `__filename`
### Core Concepts

*   **`process` Global Object:**
    *   A global object in Node.js that provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process.
    *   It is an instance of `EventEmitter`, allowing subscription to process-level events (e.g., `exit`, `uncaughtException`).
    *   Essential for interacting with the operating system environment (CLI arguments, environment variables, I/O streams).

*   **`__dirname` Global Variable:**
    *   A string that contains the absolute path of the directory that the currently executing script resides in.
    *   Crucial for building reliable, absolute file paths that are independent of the current working directory from which a script is run.

*   **`__filename` Global Variable:**
    *   A string that contains the absolute path of the file name of the currently executing script.
    *   Useful for logging, debugging, or constructing paths relative to the script itself.

### Key Details & Nuances

*   **Scope:** While often called "globals," `__dirname` and `__filename` are actually *module-scoped* variables provided by Node.js's CommonJS module wrapper, not truly global on the `global` object.
*   **`process` Properties & Methods:**
    *   `process.argv`: Array containing command-line arguments. `argv[0]` is 'node', `argv[1]` is the script path.
    *   `process.env`: Object containing the user environment variables. Critical for configuration (e.g., `process.env.PORT`, `process.env.NODE_ENV`).
    *   `process.cwd()`: Returns the current working directory of the Node.js process. **Key Distinction:** This is where the process was *started*, not necessarily where the script file is located.
    *   `process.exit([code])`: Terminates the process synchronously with an exit `code`.
    *   `process.stdin`, `process.stdout`, `process.stderr`: Streams for standard input, output, and error.
    *   `process.on('uncaughtException', handler)`: Catches synchronous errors that are not handled by a `try...catch` block. **Critical for robustness.**
    *   `process.on('unhandledRejection', handler)`: Catches rejected Promises that do not have a `.catch()` handler. **Critical for robustness in async code.**
    *   `process.nextTick(callback)`: Schedules a callback to be executed in the next turn of the event loop, before any I/O. Higher priority than `setImmediate`.
*   **ES Modules (`import`/`export`) Context:**
    *   `__dirname` and `__filename` are **not directly available** in ES module files (files using `import`/`export`).
    *   To get equivalent paths in ES Modules, use `import.meta.url` and Node.js's `path` and `url` modules:
        ```typescript
        import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
        import { dirname } from 'path';

        const __filename_esm = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
        const __dirname_esm = dirname(__filename_esm);
        ```

### Practical Examples

```typescript
// script.ts (or script.js)
import path from 'path'; // For path manipulation

console.log('--- Process Object Examples ---');

// 1. Command-line arguments
// To run: node script.js arg1 value2
console.log('process.argv:', process.argv);
// Example output: [ '/usr/local/bin/node', '/path/to/script.js', 'arg1', 'value2' ]

// 2. Environment variables
// To run: MY_ENV_VAR=hello node script.js
console.log('process.env.MY_ENV_VAR:', process.env.MY_ENV_VAR);
console.log('process.env.NODE_ENV:', process.env.NODE_ENV); // Common convention

// 3. Current Working Directory
console.log('process.cwd():', process.cwd());
// This might differ from __dirname if you run the script from a parent directory.

// 4. Basic error handling
process.on('uncaughtException', (err) => {
    console.error('Caught uncaught exception:', err.message);
    // Log the error, perform cleanup, then exit gracefully
    process.exit(1); // Non-zero exit code indicates an error
});

process.on('unhandledRejection', (reason, promise) => {
    console.error('Caught unhandled rejection at:', promise, 'reason:', reason);
    // Log the error, perform cleanup
    // Do NOT exit here unless absolutely necessary, as other promises might be pending
});

// Simulate uncaught exception
// throw new Error('Something synchronous went wrong!');

// Simulate unhandled rejection
// Promise.reject('Something async went wrong!').then(() => { /* not called */ });


console.log('\n--- __dirname & __filename Examples ---');

// 1. Basic usage
console.log('__dirname:', __dirname);
console.log('__filename:', __filename);

// 2. Building reliable paths (common pattern)
const configPath = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'config', 'app.json');
console.log('Reliable config path:', configPath);

// 3. Example of ES Modules equivalent (if this were an .mjs file or "type": "module" in package.json)
/*
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { dirname } from 'path';

const __filename_esm = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname_esm = dirname(__filename_esm);

console.log('__dirname (ESM equivalent):', __dirname_esm);
console.log('__filename (ESM equivalent):', __filename_esm);
*/
```

### Common Pitfalls & Trade-offs

*   **Confusion: `process.cwd()` vs `__dirname`:**
    *   **Pitfall:** Using `process.cwd()` to resolve relative paths for assets/modules within your application. `process.cwd()` returns the directory from which the Node.js process was *launched*, which can vary. `__dirname` always refers to the directory of the *current script*, making it reliable for resolving internal application paths.
    *   **Best Practice:** Always use `path.join(__dirname, '...')` for internal file system lookups relative to your script's location. Use `process.cwd()` primarily for context when building CLI tools or when you explicitly need the user's current directory.

*   **Ignoring `uncaughtException` / `unhandledRejection`:**
    *   **Pitfall:** Not implementing these handlers can lead to Node.js processes crashing silently or with generic stack traces in production, making debugging difficult.
    *   **Trade-off:** While crucial for resilience, these handlers should primarily log errors and perform graceful shutdown (for `uncaughtException`). They are a last resort, not a substitute for proper error handling (`try...catch`, `.catch()`) at the logical level. Exiting on `unhandledRejection` is often discouraged unless you have clear state corruption concerns, as other promises might still be pending.

*   **Security of `process.env`:**
    *   **Pitfall:** Storing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) directly in code or committing `.env` files to version control.
    *   **Best Practice:** Use environment variables (accessed via `process.env`) to configure applications at runtime. Never commit sensitive `.env` files. Use tools like `dotenv` for local development to load variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, but ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`. For production, use secure environment variable management provided by your hosting platform.

*   **ES Modules Compatibility:**
    *   **Pitfall:** Assuming `__dirname` and `__filename` are universally available in all Node.js module types.
    *   **Trade-off:** When migrating to or building with ES Modules (`.mjs` files or `"type": "module"` in `package.json`), remember to use `import.meta.url` with `path` and `url` utilities for equivalent functionality. This adds a slight overhead but aligns with modern JavaScript module standards.

### Interview Questions

1.  **"Explain the primary use cases for the `process` object in Node.js, and describe how it differs from the `global` object."**
    *   **Answer:** The `process` object provides an interface to interact with the Node.js process itself and the underlying operating system. Primary uses include accessing command-line arguments (`process.argv`), environment variables (`process.env`), managing standard I/O streams (`stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`), and handling process-level events like exit or uncaught exceptions (`process.on('exit')`, `process.on('uncaughtException')`). While both are global-like, `process` is specifically for process control and OS interaction, whereas `global` is the actual global namespace object (like `window` in browsers) where true global variables reside.

2.  **"What is the key difference between `__dirname`, `__filename`, and `process.cwd()`? In what scenarios would you use each?"**
    *   **Answer:**
        *   `__dirname`: Absolute path to the directory of the *currently executing script*. Use: building reliable, environment-independent paths to application assets, configuration files, or other modules relative to the script's location.
        *   `__filename`: Absolute path to the *currently executing script file*. Use: logging, debugging, or creating paths relative to the script file itself.
        *   `process.cwd()`: The *current working directory* of the Node.js process. This is where the process was launched from. Use: in CLI tools when you need to know where the user invoked the command, or to access files relative to the user's execution context.
    *   **Key difference:** `__dirname` and `__filename` are tied to the script's physical location, while `process.cwd()` is tied to the shell's current directory where the Node process was started.

3.  **"How would you handle application configuration using `process.env`? Discuss the security implications and best practices."**
    *   **Answer:** Application configuration should primarily use `process.env` to inject runtime specific values (e.g., database connection strings, API keys, port numbers). This allows configuration to be externalized from the code, making applications more portable and secure.
    *   **Security Implications:** Sensitive data in `process.env` should never be hardcoded or committed to version control. It can be exposed if the server is compromised or if not properly managed.
    *   **Best Practices:**
        1.  Use `.env` files for *local development* only, and ensure they are `gitignore`d. Libraries like `dotenv` can load these into `process.env`.
        2.  For production, rely on the deployment environment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure) to securely manage and inject environment variables at runtime.
        3.  Sanitize and validate environment variables on application startup.
        4.  Avoid logging `process.env` directly in production logs.

4.  **"Describe the importance of `process.on('uncaughtException')` and `process.on('unhandledRejection')` in a production Node.js application."**
    *   **Answer:** These are critical last-resort error handlers.
        *   `uncaughtException`: Catches *synchronous errors* that bubble up to the event loop without being caught by `try...catch` blocks. Without this, the Node.js process will crash immediately. In production, this handler should log the error, perform any necessary graceful cleanup (e.g., closing database connections), and then exit the process (with `process.exit(1)`) so that a process manager (like PM2 or Kubernetes) can restart it, ensuring high availability.
        *   `unhandledRejection`: Catches *Promise rejections* that occur without a corresponding `.catch()` handler. Without this, Node.js might log a warning and eventually exit (or just log a warning and continue, depending on version). In production, this handler should log the reason for the rejection and the promise that was rejected. Unlike `uncaughtException`, it's often not advisable to `process.exit()` immediately on `unhandledRejection`, as other async operations might still be pending; focus on logging and understanding the root cause. Both are vital for preventing unexpected crashes and gaining visibility into runtime errors.
