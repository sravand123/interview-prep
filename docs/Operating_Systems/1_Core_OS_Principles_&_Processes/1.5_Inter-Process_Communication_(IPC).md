## Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
### Core Concepts
*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Mechanisms allowing independent processes to exchange data and synchronize activities.
*   **Necessity:** Processes are typically isolated by the OS for security and stability. IPC bypasses this isolation in a controlled manner, enabling:
    *   **Information Sharing:** Multiple processes can access the same data.
    *   **Modularity:** Complex systems can be broken into smaller, cooperating processes.
    *   **Resource Sharing:** Processes can share system resources.
    *   **Synchronization:** Processes can coordinate their execution.

### Key Details & Nuances
*   **Categorization by Data Transfer:**
    *   **Message Passing:** Processes communicate by sending and receiving discrete messages. The OS handles buffering and delivery. Examples: Pipes, Message Queues, Sockets.
    *   **Shared Memory:** Processes access a common region of memory. Fastest method as it avoids kernel copy, but requires explicit synchronization.
*   **Common IPC Mechanisms:**
    *   **Pipes (Anonymous/Named):**
        *   **Anonymous Pipes:** Unidirectional byte stream. Used for communication between related processes (e.g., parent-child) via file descriptors. Limited buffer.
        *   **Named Pipes (FIFOs):** Unidirectional byte stream. Appear as files in the file system, allowing communication between unrelated processes. Slower due to file system interaction.
    *   **Message Queues:**
        *   Kernel-managed list of messages. Messages have types, allowing selective retrieval.
        *   Offers message persistence (until read or system reboot) and prioritization.
        *   Higher overhead than pipes due to message header processing and kernel copies.
    *   **Shared Memory:**
        *   Fastest IPC mechanism. A region of memory is mapped into the address space of multiple processes.
        *   No kernel intervention during data transfer once setup.
        *   **Critical Nuance:** Requires explicit synchronization mechanisms (e.g., semaphores, mutexes) to prevent race conditions, as the OS provides no built-in concurrency control for the shared region.
    *   **Semaphores:**
        *   Synchronization primitive, not for data transfer itself.
        *   Used to protect critical sections of code or shared resources (like shared memory) from concurrent access.
        *   Can be binary (mutex) or counting.
    *   **Sockets:**
        *   Most flexible and widely used. Primarily for network communication, but also for local IPC (Unix Domain Sockets).
        *   Can be stream-oriented (TCP) or datagram-oriented (UDP).
        *   Full-duplex (bidirectional) communication. Allows communication between unrelated processes, even on different machines.
    *   **Signals:**
        *   Asynchronous notifications (e.g., `SIGTERM`, `SIGKILL`).
        *   Very limited data transfer (just a signal type). Primarily for event notification or process control. Not true data IPC.
*   **Kernel Involvement:**
    *   **High (Kernel Copy):** Pipes, Message Queues, Sockets (involve kernel for buffering, copying data between user/kernel space).
    *   **Low (Direct Access):** Shared Memory (kernel sets up mapping, but data transfer is direct between processes).

### Practical Examples

**1. Pipe (Node.js/Shell)**
*   **Concept:** Parent process spawns a child process and pipes its `stdout` to the parent's `stdin`.

```typescript
// parent.js
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

const child = spawn('node', ['child.js'], {
    stdio: ['pipe', 'pipe', 'inherit'] // stdin, stdout, stderr for child
});

child.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
    console.log(`Parent received: ${data}`);
    // Simulate sending data back (requires child to read stdin)
    // child.stdin.write('Hello Child!\n');
});

child.on('close', (code) => {
    console.log(`Child process exited with code ${code}`);
});

child.stdin.end(); // Close child's stdin
```

```typescript
// child.js
process.stdout.write('Hello from Child!');

// If parent was writing to child's stdin:
// process.stdin.on('data', (data) => {
//     console.log(`Child received: ${data}`);
// });
```

**2. Shared Memory Conceptual Flow**
*   **Concept:** Two processes access the same memory region for direct data exchange, requiring a semaphore for coordination.

```mermaid
graph TD;
    P1["Process A starts"];
    P2["Process B starts"];
    SM["Shared Memory Segment created/attached"];
    SEM["Semaphore created/initialized"];
    P1 --> SM;
    P2 --> SM;
    P1 --> SEM;
    P2 --> SEM;
    P1 --"Acquire Semaphore"--> P1_W["Process A writes to Shared Memory"];
    P1_W --"Release Semaphore"--> SEM;
    P2 --"Acquire Semaphore"--> P2_R["Process B reads from Shared Memory"];
    P2_R --"Release Semaphore"--> SEM;
    SM --> "Data Exchange";
```

### Common Pitfalls & Trade-offs
*   **Synchronization with Shared Memory:** The most common pitfall. Without proper locking (mutexes, semaphores), shared memory will lead to race conditions, data corruption, and crashes. This burden is on the developer.
*   **Data Copying Overhead:** Mechanisms like pipes, message queues, and sockets involve copying data from user space to kernel space, then to the destination user space. This introduces latency and CPU overhead, especially for large data volumes. Shared memory avoids this, making it faster.
*   **Complexity vs. Performance:**
    *   **Simpler IPC (Pipes, Signals):** Easy to implement for basic communication but limited in features (e.g., unidirectional, no message structure).
    *   **Higher-Level IPC (Message Queues, Sockets):** Offer more features (e.g., structured messages, network transparency) but introduce more overhead and configuration complexity.
    *   **Fastest IPC (Shared Memory):** Highest performance, but highest complexity due to manual synchronization.
*   **System Resource Limits:** IPC mechanisms often have system-wide limits (e.g., number of open pipes, size of message queues, number of shared memory segments). Exceeding these can lead to resource exhaustion errors.
*   **Deadlock:** A risk when multiple processes use multiple shared resources (e.g., multiple semaphores) and block each other indefinitely.

### Interview Questions
1.  **Q:** Compare and contrast `pipes` and `shared memory` for IPC, highlighting their typical use cases and major trade-offs.
    *   **A:** Pipes (anonymous/named) are byte streams, typically unidirectional, and involve kernel copying, suitable for simpler, often related process communication (e.g., `cmd1 | cmd2`). Shared memory allows direct memory access between processes for high-speed data exchange by mapping a common memory region. Its major trade-off is the absolute requirement for explicit developer-managed synchronization (e.g., semaphores) to prevent race conditions, which pipes handle implicitly via their sequential nature. Shared memory is preferred for large data volumes or performance-critical scenarios.

2.  **Q:** When would you choose `Unix Domain Sockets` over `named pipes` or `message queues` for IPC on a single machine?
    *   **A:** Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) offer a full network socket API, providing bidirectional, reliable (stream sockets) or unreliable (datagram sockets) communication. They are generally more flexible than named pipes (which are unidirectional byte streams) and can be significantly faster than network sockets for local IPC as they bypass network stack overhead. Compared to message queues, UDS offer a more generalized stream/datagram model, which can be beneficial for complex protocols, while message queues are more suited for discrete, structured message passing with features like prioritization. UDS are excellent for client-server architectures locally.

3.  **Q:** Explain the role of `semaphores` in IPC. Can they be used for data transfer?
    *   **A:** Semaphores are synchronization primitives, not data transfer mechanisms. Their primary role in IPC is to control access to shared resources (like shared memory segments) or critical sections of code, preventing race conditions. They act as counters that processes can increment (`signal` or `V`) or decrement (`wait` or `P`). A process attempting to decrement a zero semaphore will block until another process increments it. They are crucial for orchestrating concurrent access to shared data but do not carry the data itself.

4.  **Q:** Describe a scenario where `signals` would be an appropriate IPC mechanism, and one where they would be entirely inappropriate.
    *   **A:** Signals are appropriate for asynchronous, limited-information event notification or process control. For example, sending a `SIGTERM` to gracefully shut down a process, or `SIGUSR1`/`SIGUSR2` to trigger a specific handler (e.g., reload configuration) without interrupting the main execution flow. They would be entirely inappropriate for transferring large amounts of data, structured messages, or maintaining a continuous communication stream, as they are not designed for data payload and can be lost or reordered.

5.  **Q:** You're designing a high-performance logging system where multiple processes need to write log entries to a central log collector process. Which IPC mechanism would you choose and why? Consider performance, data integrity, and system design.
    *   **A:** For high-performance logging, I would likely choose **Shared Memory with a Ring Buffer and Semaphores/Mutexes**.
        *   **Why Shared Memory:** It offers the lowest latency and highest throughput as it avoids kernel data copies. Logger processes can write directly into the shared buffer.
        *   **Ring Buffer:** An efficient data structure for fixed-size continuous writes and reads, preventing unbounded growth and simplifying management.
        *   **Semaphores/Mutexes:** Absolutely critical for coordinating access to the shared ring buffer, ensuring mutual exclusion for writes and signaling new data available for the collector to read (e.g., one semaphore for available slots, another for filled slots).
        *   **Alternatives considered:** Message queues introduce kernel copy overhead. Sockets are more flexible but also add overhead. Pipes are too limited for multiple writers and structured log entries. The direct access of shared memory is paramount for "high-performance."
